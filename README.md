![MakeMeDev Logo](./imgs/mmd.png)

## Ground Rules

1. Class meets twice a week, Wednesday's and Sunday's. Wednesday class hours are 7-10PM and Sunday class hours are 4-7PM.

2. As we cover so much ground so quickly, this is a boot-camp after all ðŸ˜Ž, students are advised to limit absences. Essentially a student who misses more than one class may have great difficulty keeping up with further instruction.

3. Students are expected to complete class assignments, assessments, and portfolio-projects. These assessments and assignments are essential to this program, you are a self-taught developer and will be expected to demonstrate your skills to a substantial degree, our coursework will help you do so.
